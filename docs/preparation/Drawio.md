# How to Use Draw.io for Block Diagrams

## Getting Started with Draw.io

1. Go to [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) or open the desktop application
2. Select where you want to save your diagrams (Google Drive, OneDrive, Device, etc.)
3. Create a new diagram or open an existing one

## Importing Libraries

To import custom shape libraries like `Scratchpad.xml` or `ECE.xml`:

1. Click on **File** → **Open Library from** → **Device**
2. Select the XML file you downloaded (e.g., `Scratchpad.xml` or `ECE.xml`)
3. The library will appear in the left sidebar under "Scratchpad" or the library name
4. You can now drag and drop components from the library onto your canvas

## Adding Components

1. **From Libraries**: Drag components from the left sidebar onto the canvas
2. **From Shapes**: Use the search bar to find standard shapes (rectangles, arrows, etc.)
3. **Connecting Components**: 
   - Hover over a shape to see connection points (blue dots)
   - Click and drag from one connection point to another to create arrows/lines
4. **Adding Text**: Double-click on any shape to add or edit text
5. **Styling**: Use the right panel to change colors, line styles, and fonts

## Tips for Block Diagrams

- Use **Ctrl+D** (or **Cmd+D** on Mac) to duplicate components
- Use **Ctrl+G** to group multiple components together
- Right-click on a connector to change arrow styles
- Use the **Arrange** menu to align and distribute shapes evenly

# Exercise: Draw Block Diagrams

Practice creating block diagrams by recreating the following two diagrams:

## 1. Finite State Machine (FSM) Diagram

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="../images/fsm.png" alt="FSM Block Diagram" />
<p><em>Figure: Finite State Machine block diagram</em></p>
</div>

Recreate this FSM block diagram using draw.io. Pay attention to:
- State circles/boxes
- Transition arrows with labels
- Input/output notation

## 2. IR Remote Block Diagram

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="../images/ir_remote.png" alt="IR Remote Block Diagram" />
<p><em>Figure: IR Remote control block diagram</em></p>
</div>

Recreate this IR remote control block diagram. Focus on:
- Component blocks and their connections
- Signal flow direction
- Proper labeling of each component
