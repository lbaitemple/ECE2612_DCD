# Digital Circuit Design
## ECE 2612 - Spring 2026

This comprehensive course covers digital circuit design from fundamental concepts through advanced FPGA implementation. Students will master Boolean algebra, combinational and sequential logic design, Verilog HDL programming, and hands-on FPGA development using industry-standard tools.

## Course Overview

Learn to design, analyze, and implement digital systems using modern hardware description languages and FPGA development boards. This course emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical implementation skills essential for computer engineering and embedded systems careers.

### What You'll Learn

- **Digital Logic Fundamentals**: Boolean algebra, logic gates, and truth tables
- **Combinational Circuits**: Multiplexers, decoders, adders, and ALU design  
- **Verilog HDL**: Hardware description language for digital design
