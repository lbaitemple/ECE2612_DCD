## 💡 Tips for Success

### Study Strategies
- **Practice Regularly**: Digital design requires hands-on experience
- **Build Incrementally**: Test small pieces before combining
- **Draw Diagrams**: Visualize circuits and state machines
- **Comment Code**: Future you will thank present you
- **Debug Systematically**: Use simulation, not just FPGA testing

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Waiting until last minute for assignments
- ❌ Skipping simulation and going straight to hardware
- ❌ Not backing up your work
- ❌ Copying code without understanding
- ❌ Ignoring timing issues

### Best Practices
- ✅ Start assignments early
- ✅ Test thoroughly with testbenches
- ✅ Use version control (Git)
- ✅ Follow Verilog coding standards
- ✅ Document your designs

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Software Issues
- **Quartus won't compile**: Check for syntax errors, save all files
- **Simulation doesn't work**: Verify testbench, check `timescale`
- **Programming fails**: Check USB connection, device selection

### Hardware Issues
- **FPGA not detected**: Check drivers, try different USB port
- **Circuit doesn't work**: Verify pin assignments, check syntax
- **Unexpected behavior**: Review timing constraints, add synchronizers

### Getting Help
1. Check module documentation
2. Search online (Stack Overflow, FPGA forums)
3. Ask on course discussion board
4. Attend office hours
5. Email instructor for private issues
